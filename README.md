# Run_Analysis
A repository containing R code that I've used to analyse my own run data downloaded from RunKeeper. 

## Disclaimers:
This was written as a pet project when I was first learning R. So don't judge me. 

Also, don't ask me to explain the Haversin formula. I have no idea how or why that works.

I don't know how much of the code still runs. In particular the code to scrape weather data almost certainly doesn't work becuase the website has changed.
